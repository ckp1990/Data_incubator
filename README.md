# Data_incubator
This repository consist of all the graphs and code line required to submit in data incubator semi final round.
There are two posiiable graphs in this reporitory. 

1) First graph represent the number of fire year in last 3 decades in each county of United States of America. 

2) For second graph, I have auro-correlation value of all the county with more that 20 fire year in last 30 years. 
later I ploted maximun auto correlation value on y axis and county on x axis with colour gradient as lag years. This graph suggest the maximum likihood of fire events in the given lag year.
